### VIII. üõ°Ô∏è Security

Ensuring the application is secure and protects user data.

-   **Data Protection**:
    -   **Feature**: RLS for Database Access Control.
        *Description: Supabase Row Level Security policies strictly enforce that users can only access their own conversations and messages, and admins have appropriate broader access.*
    -   **Feature**: Input Validation.
        *Description: All user-generated input (messages, search queries, profile info) is validated and sanitized to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks.*
    -   **Feature**: Secure External Link Handling.
        *Description: Links shared in messages are opened with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to mitigate security risks.*
-   **Communication**:
    -   **Feature**: HTTPS/WSS for all data transmission.
        *Description: All communication between the client, Next.js server, and Supabase occurs over encrypted channels.*
-   **Authentication**:
    -   **Feature**: Secure Session Management.
        *Description: Leverages Supabase Auth's secure session handling, including JWTs, cookie management, and token refresh mechanisms.*
    -   **Feature**: Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks.
        *Description: Supabase Auth provides default rate limiting and lockout mechanisms for login attempts.*

Step by Step, well documented Phases and Tasks.

1.  **Phase S1: RLS Implementation & Verification**
    *   Task S1.1: Define and apply comprehensive RLS policies for all tables in `supabase-setup.sql`.
    *   Task S1.2: Write and execute tests to verify RLS policies correctly restrict data access for different user roles and scenarios.
2.  **Phase S2: Input Validation & Sanitization**
    *   Task S2.1: Implement input validation for all forms (login, message input, search).
    *   Task S2.2: Ensure message content is sanitized before rendering to prevent XSS.
    *   Task S2.3: Implement secure link handling for URLs in messages.
3.  **Phase S3: Secure Configuration & Best Practices**
    *   Task S3.1: Ensure all client-server communication uses HTTPS/WSS.
    *   Task S3.2: Review Supabase Auth settings for security best practices (e.g., email confirmation if applicable, password strength).
    *   Task S3.3: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Task S3.4: Conduct a security review of middleware and server-side logic.
    *   Task S3.5: Implement GDPR/privacy compliance measures (e.g., data consent, right to be forgotten).
    *   Task S3.6: Create a security audit checklist and schedule regular audits.
    *   Task S3.7: Define incident response procedures for security breaches.
