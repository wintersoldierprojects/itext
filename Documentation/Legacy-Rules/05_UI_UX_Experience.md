### V. ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX, Animations & Mobile Experience

Ensuring the application not only functions like Instagram DMs but also feels like it.

-   **Visual Design**:
    -   **Feature**: Pixel-Perfect Instagram Styling.
        *Description: Adherence to Instagram's color palette (blues, grays, black, white, accents), spacing, and typography as defined in `INSTAGRAM-DESIGN-GUIDE.md`.*
    -   **Feature**: Instagram Iconography.
        *Description: Use of icons that match or are stylistically similar to those used in Instagram DMs.*
    -   **Feature**: Loading Skeletons & Shimmer Effects.
        *Description: Instagram-style loading placeholders for conversations and messages to improve perceived performance.*
-   **Animations**:
    -   **Feature**: Smooth Page Transitions.
        *Description: Native-feeling slide transitions (e.g., conversation list to full chat) using appropriate easing curves (e.g., `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` for iOS feel), typically 300ms.*
    -   **Feature**: Message Send/Receive Animations.
        *Description: Messages slide up and fade in when sent or received (approx. 250ms duration).*
    -   **Feature**: Micro-interactions.
        *Description: Subtle animations for button presses (e.g., scale down to 0.95), hover states, and other small interactions to provide feedback.*
    -   **Feature**: 60fps Performance Target.
        *Description: All animations and transitions are optimized to run smoothly at 60 frames per second, utilizing GPU acceleration where possible.*
-   **Mobile & Touch Interactions**:
    -   **Feature**: Touch-Optimized Interface.
        *Description: All interactive elements have minimum touch targets of 44x44px.*
    -   **Feature**: Gesture Support.
        *Description: Includes swipe gestures (e.g., on conversation items for actions), double-tap (e.g., for heart reaction), long-press (e.g., for reaction picker), and pull-to-refresh in chat views.*
    -   **Feature**: Haptic Feedback.
        *Description: Use of device vibration to provide tactile feedback for key interactions, simulating a native app feel (e.g., light for taps, medium for message send).*
    -   **Feature**: Safe Area Handling for Notched Devices.
        *Description: UI correctly adapts to screen notches and home indicators on modern mobile devices using `env(safe-area-inset-*)` CSS variables.*
    -   **Feature**: Responsive Layouts for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop.
        *Description: While primarily a mobile DM replica, the layout should be usable on tablet and desktop, potentially offering different views (e.g., split view on desktop).*
