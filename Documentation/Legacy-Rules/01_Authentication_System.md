# ðŸ”’ Authentication System

Handles secure login and session management for both Admins and Users, ensuring role-based access and data protection.

-   **Admin Authentication Flow**:
    -   **Feature**: Secure Email/Password Login (`/admin` route).
        *Description: Admins log in using dedicated credentials (`admin@cherrygifts.com`).*
    -   **Feature**: Database Role Verification.
        *Description: System queries Supabase to confirm 'admin' role post-authentication before granting dashboard access.*
    -   **Feature**: Persistent Sessions.
        *Description: Admin login is maintained across browser restarts using Supabase Auth session management.*
    -   **Feature**: Auto-Redirect to Dashboard.
        *Description: Authenticated admins attempting to access the login page are automatically redirected to `/admin/dashboard`.*
    -   **Feature**: Real-time Auth State Listening.
        *Description: UI dynamically reflects authentication status changes.*
    -   **Feature**: Transparent Access Denied Errors.
        *Description: If role verification fails, a clear error message is displayed, indicating the issue (e.g., "Access denied. Your role: user").*
-   **User Authentication Flow**:
    -   **Feature**: Instagram Username + PIN Login (`/users` route).
        *Description: Users log in with their Instagram username and a secure PIN.*
    -   **Feature**: Real-time Profile Preview.
        *Description: During username entry, a preview of the user's Instagram profile picture (if available via a mock or real service) is shown for verification.*
    -   **Feature**: Auto-Registration for New Users.
        *Description: A new user profile is automatically created in Supabase upon the first successful login if one doesn't already exist.*
    -   **Feature**: Secure PIN Handling.
        *Description: PINs are handled securely (e.g., not stored in plain text if custom auth is built on top of Supabase basic auth).*
    -   **Feature**: Persian Language Support & RTL for Login Page.
        *Description: The user login page (`/users`) is presented in Persian with appropriate Right-to-Left text direction.*
-   **General Auth Features**:
    -   **Feature**: JWT Session Management.
        *Description: Utilizes Supabase's default JWT-based session handling with automatic token refresh.*
    -   **Feature**: Middleware Route Protection.
        *Description: Next.js middleware enforces authentication and role checks for protected routes (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`, `/users/chat`).*
    -   **Feature**: Secure Logout.
        *Description: Provides a secure way for users and admins to end their sessions.*
    -   **Feature**: Enhanced Security Measures.
        *Description: Consider implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admins. Enforce strong password policies (min length, complexity, rotation) for admin accounts. Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.*
    -   **Feature**: Detailed Error Handling & Recovery.
        *Description: Provide specific error messages for different authentication failures (e.g., invalid credentials, account locked, network issues). Implement clear recovery paths for forgotten passwords/PINs. Log authentication attempts for auditing.*
    -   **Feature**: Rate Limiting.
        *Description: Implement API rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.*
