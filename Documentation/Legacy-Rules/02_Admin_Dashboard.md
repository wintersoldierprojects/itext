### II. üñ•Ô∏è Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)

The central hub for admins to manage customer conversations, designed as a pixel-perfect Instagram DM replica.

-   **UI & Layout**:
    -   **Feature**: Pure Instagram DM Interface.
        *Description: Full-width layout, no traditional sidebars, mimicking the Instagram mobile DM experience.*
    -   **Feature**: Conversation List.
        *Description: Displays all user conversations in Instagram-style sidebar, sorted by the most recent message. Each item shows user avatar, username, last message snippet, and timestamp.*
    -   **Feature**: Full-Screen Chat View.
        *Description: Selecting a conversation transitions to a full-screen chat interface for that specific user.*
    -   **Feature**: Responsive Design.
        *Description: While mobile-first, the layout adapts gracefully to desktop and tablet screen sizes, potentially showing list and chat side-by-side on larger screens if desired (though primary spec is mobile replica).*
-   **Conversation Management**:
    -   **Feature**: Real-time Conversation Search.
        *Description: Admin can search existing conversations by username, full name, or message content, with results filtering in real-time.*
    -   **Feature**: Unread Message Indicators.
        *Description: Conversations with unread messages are visually distinct (e.g., bolded text, Instagram-blue dot, unread count badge).*
    -   **Feature**: Admin-Specific Message Bubble Styling.
        *Description: Messages sent by the admin appear with a light gray background (`#EFEFEF`) and black text.*
-   **User Monitoring**:
    -   **Feature**: User Online Status Display.
        *Description: Visual cues (e.g., green dot for online, "last seen" for offline) indicate a user's current presence. Offline users show a "last seen" timestamp.*
-   **Performance & Scalability**:
    -   **Feature**: Optimized for Large Volumes.
        *Description: Conversation list and chat view are optimized to handle thousands of messages and hundreds of conversations without performance degradation.*
    -   **Feature**: Batch Operations (Admin).
        *Description: Ability for admins to perform bulk actions on conversations (e.g., mark all as read, archive multiple, delete multiple).*
    -   **Feature**: Conversation Archival/Deletion.
        *Description: Admins can archive old conversations to de-clutter the active list or permanently delete conversations (with confirmation).*
