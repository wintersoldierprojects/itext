# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on transforming the existing chat application into a production-ready Instagram DM replica. This involves implementing missing real-time features, perfecting Instagram styling and animations, and ensuring stable synchronization between admin and user dashboards.

## Recent Changes
The memory bank has been updated with the comprehensive project plan from the `.clinerules` directory, including:
- Project Vision
- Authentication System details
- Admin Dashboard features
- User Interface features
- Core Messaging & Chat features
- UI/UX, Animations & Mobile Experience details
- PWA & Offline Capabilities (removed)
- Technical Infrastructure & Performance details
- Security features
- Consolidated Implementation Phases & Tasks (High-Level Project Roadmap)

## Next Steps
The next task is to implement the Message Status System, which is Task 5 in Phase 2 of the Consolidated Implementation Phases & Tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project aims for sub-100ms real-time message delivery latency.
- Pixel-perfect Instagram styling is a key design requirement.
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms are crucial.
- All database schema is already in place; implementation is purely frontend/hooks.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Next.js with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Turbopack as the build system.
- Supabase for backend (PostgreSQL, Realtime, Auth).
- PWA features removed; Serwist no longer used.
- Modular component structure.
- Optimistic UI updates.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project is currently estimated to be 30% complete, with a target of 100% completion in 4 weeks.
- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) and Phase 2 (Message Features) are marked as COMPLETE in the provided roadmap.
- Phase 3 (Interactive Features) and Phase 4 (Performance & Polish) are PENDING.

## Project Overview (from cherrygifts-app-robust-progress-temporary.md)

### Current State Analysis
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Complete (all tables and fields ready)
- ✅ **Basic UI Structure**: Instagram-style layout implemented
- ✅ **Authentication**: Admin and user login working
- ⚠️ **Chat Functionality**: Only 30% complete (basic messaging only)
- ❌ **Real-time Features**: Missing most claimed features
- ❌ **Instagram Styling**: Incorrect colors and components

### Target Goals
Transform the current 30% complete chat into a **production-ready Instagram DM replica** with:
- Real-time messaging with <100ms latency
- Complete message status tracking (sent/delivered/read)
- User online status and reactions
- Perfect Instagram styling and animations
- Stable admin/user dashboard synchronization

## Progress Log

### Completed Tasks
*Tasks will be moved here as they are completed*

### Current Task
**Next Up**: Task 5 - Implement Message Status System

### Notes
- This plan transforms the current 30% complete chat into a production-ready Instagram DM replica
- Each task builds upon previous work without breaking existing functionality
- Focus on stability and synchronization between admin and user dashboards
- All database schema is already in place - implementation is purely frontend/hooks
