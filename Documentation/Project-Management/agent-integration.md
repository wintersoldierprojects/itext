# ðŸ”„ Agent Integration Workflow

**Purpose**: Coordinate parallel agent work through a single integration branch to avoid conflicts.

## ðŸŒ± Shared Branch
- Branch name: `integration`
- All agents push their commits to this branch sequentially.

## ðŸ“¥ Before Each Update
1. `git fetch origin integration`
2. `git checkout integration`
3. `git pull`

## ðŸš€ After Commit
- Run `git push origin integration` to share changes.
- Notify other agents to re-fetch before they continue.
