## **🔄 SEQUENTIAL MCP EXECUTION RULES**

### **CRITICAL RULE: ONE MCP AT A TIME**
**No matter the task or situation, ALWAYS execute MCPs sequentially:**

1. **Start MCP 1** → Execute completely → Write results to file
2. **After MCP 1 finishes** → Start MCP 2 → Append results to same file  
3. **After MCP 2 finishes** → Start MCP 3 → Append results to same file
5. **Based on analysis** → Send file to next MCP chain OR complete task

### **File Management Protocol**:
- Each task gets ONE consolidated file
- Each MCP appends its results with timestamps
- Final file contains all perspectives for comprehensive analysis

### **Method Compatibility**:
- **Method 1 (Multi-MCP Validation)**: 4 MCPs work on same task, one after another, all write to same file
- **Method 2 (Chaining)**: Already sequential by design, output of one feeds into next

## **🤝 MCP TEAM ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS**

### **Pattern 1: Research Convergence (Sequential Multi-MCP)**
**When**: Need comprehensive understanding of complex topics  

```markdown
## Research Task: [TOPIC]

### MCP 1: Context7 Analysis
[Context7 executes alone, writes latest documentation findings]

### MCP 2: Exa Research  
[Exa executes alone, writes market analysis below Context7 results]

### MCP 3: Perplexity Investigation
[Perplexity executes alone, writes technical analysis below Exa results]

**Consensus**: [Points where all MCPs align]
**Conflicts**: [Areas needing further investigation]
**Synthesis**: [Combined insights and recommended approach]
**Next Chain**: [Send this file to next MCP set if needed]
```

### **Pattern 2: Validation Matrix (Sequential Multi-MCP)**
**When**: Need multi-dimensional quality assurance  
**Execution**: ONE MCP at a time, each adds results to same validation file

```markdown
## Validation Report: [FEATURE/FIX]

**Functional Testing**: [Pass/Fail with details]
**User Experience**: [Observations and metrics]

### MCP 2: BrowserStack Validation
**Cross-Platform**: [Compatibility matrix]
**Performance**: [Metrics across devices]

**Error Detection**: [No new issues detected]
**Performance Impact**: [Before/after metrics]

**Overall Status**: [PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL]
**Rationale**: [Data-driven decision from all 3 MCPs]
**Next Chain**: [If FAIL, send to debugging MCP chain]
```

### **Pattern 3: Problem Resolution Pipeline**
**When**: Systematic debugging and improvement
```markdown
## Issue Resolution: [PROBLEM_ID]
**Issue**: [Detailed problem description]
**Impact**: [User/system impact metrics]

### Analysis (Sequential Thinking MCP)
**Hypothesis**: [Potential root causes]
**Investigation Plan**: [Systematic steps]
