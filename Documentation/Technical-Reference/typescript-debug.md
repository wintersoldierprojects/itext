## 🚀 Run the TypeScript Checker

Execute this command from the repository root to validate all TypeScript files without generating output:

```bash
yarn dlx tsc --noEmit > typescript-debug.md 2>&1
```

The compiler output is redirected to `typescript-debug.md` in the project root.

## 📖 Understanding Compiler Messages

- Each error line begins with the file path and a line/column reference.
- `error TS####:` messages indicate problems that must be fixed before a successful build.
- Review the log from top to bottom and address the errors in order.

## 📁 Log File Location

- The log file generated by the command above should always be stored as `typescript-debug.md` in the repository root.
- Overwrite this file whenever you rerun the checker to keep the log up to date.
- Do not commit the log unless specifically requested for debugging.

## 🤝 Sharing Logs in Pull Requests

Include a brief summary of the TypeScript check in your PR description. If errors remain, paste the relevant snippets from `typescript-debug.md`.

Example PR snippet:

```markdown
### TypeScript Check
yarn dlx tsc --noEmit > typescript-debug.md 2>&1
