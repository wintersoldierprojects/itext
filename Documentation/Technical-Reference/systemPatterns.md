        *Description: System actively monitors WebSocket connection status and attempts automatic reconnection with exponential backoff upon failure.*
    -   **Feature**: Performance Monitoring Dashboard (Admin).
        *Description: A dedicated section (`/admin/metrics`) for admins to view real-time performance metrics like message latency, FPS, memory usage, and error rates.*
    -   **Feature**: Code Splitting & Lazy Loading.
        *Description: Next.js default code splitting and strategic lazy loading of components/images to improve initial page load times.*

Step by Step, well documented Phases and Tasks.

1.  **Phase TI1: Backend Setup & Schema**
    *   Task TI1.1: Execute `supabase-setup.sql` (via MCP or manually) to create all tables, RLS policies, and database functions.
    *   Task TI1.2: Verify entire schema, RLS, and real-time publications are correctly set up in Supabase.
    *   Task TI1.3: Implement singleton pattern for Supabase client (`lib/supabase.ts`).
2.  **Phase TI2: Frontend Core Architecture**
    *   Task TI2.1: Ensure Next.js project is correctly configured with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
    *   Task TI2.2: Configure Turbopack as the default build system and optimize its settings.
    *   Task TI2.3: Establish a clear and modular component structure.
3.  **Phase TI3: Real-time Integration & Error Handling**
    *   Task TI3.1: Implement the `SupabaseRealtimeManager` (from WebSocket solution plan) for robust connection handling.
    *   Task TI3.2: Integrate this manager into all hooks requiring real-time data (`useMessages`, `useUserStatus`, `useReactions`, `useTyping`).
    *   Task TI3.3: Implement React Error Boundaries at key points in the application.
    *   Task TI3.4: Ensure optimistic UI updates are correctly reconciled with server responses.
4.  **Phase TI4: Performance Systems**
    *   Task TI4.1: Develop the performance data collection mechanisms (`lib/performance.ts`).
    *   Task TI4.2: Create the Admin Performance Monitoring Dashboard (`/admin/metrics`).
    *   Task TI4.3: Implement connection health UI indicators (using `ConnectionStatus` component).
    *   Task TI4.4: Review and optimize critical database queries for performance.
    *   Task TI4.5: Implement comprehensive logging and centralized log management.
    *   Task TI4.6: Define and implement disaster recovery and backup strategies for the database.
